# MulleObjCStandardFoundation

#### ðŸš¤ Objective-C classes based on the C standard library

This library builds on [MulleObjCValueFoundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation/MulleObjCValueFoundation)
and [MulleObjCContainerFoundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation/MulleObjCContainerFoundation) and
introduces a lot of additional classes.

But it does not I/O (not even `stdio`). I/O is provided by 
MulleObjCOSFoundation.

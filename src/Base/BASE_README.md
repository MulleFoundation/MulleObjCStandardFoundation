# Base

The whole project will slowly move from MulleObjC prefix and Foundation
suffix to MulleFoundation prefix and empty suffix, at least for files.

Classes will probably get a shorter MF (MulleFoundation) prefix.
But C functions and structs will not.


TODO:  maybe rename mulle-objc-rootconfiguration to
mulle-objc-runtime-configuration or mulle-objc-universeconfiguration ?

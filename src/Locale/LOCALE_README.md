# Locale

Much of the locale handling is OS specific and will be augmented by
the POSIX foundation.

This part of the Foundation is very incomplete still, especially with
regard to "localizedDescription" implementations.

For a minimal Foundation, this could be left out, but not having the formatters
might hurt more than it helps.

## Categories

Categories contains categories on classes, that are defined not in Locale.
